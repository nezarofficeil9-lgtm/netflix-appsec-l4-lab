# Security Engineering Lab (AppSec)

A practical, security-first backend lab focused on building and hardening services and REST APIs.
This repo contains hands-on demos, tests, and small tools that map to common AppSec problem areas:
authentication/authorization, input validation, secure configuration, logging/monitoring, and review-ready security controls.

## What’s Inside
- Secure Auth & Sessions (JWT / RBAC patterns)
- API Hardening (validation, rate limiting, safe errors)
- Threat Modeling notes + security review checklists
- Lightweight AppSec tooling demos (SAST/DAST friendly structure)
- Testable examples with reproducible steps

## Quick Start (coming next)
- Requirements and setup instructions
- Run commands
- Demo endpoints
- Security test cases

## Project Structure (coming next)
We will add:
- `src/` application code
- `docs/` threat model + security review notes
- `tests/` test cases

## Notes
This repository is designed to be easy to review: clear README, consistent structure,
and security decisions documented in `docs/`.
